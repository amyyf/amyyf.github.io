					I'm using the word "making" here to be intentionally broad. In the
					spirit of
					<span class="text--ital">doing things when you think of them</span>,
					I'm putting this page up while my goals for this space are still
					forming. I am thinking a lot these days about fiber arts and garment
					making, but I want to reserve the right to discuss coding or design as
					well. I'll try to organize topics as I go.
