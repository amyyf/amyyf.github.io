The first version of this site was the first project I submitted for my bootcamp: a personal portfolio, a practical first project and one I had fun with. I'm totally revamping it 3 years post-bootcamp. The space will continue to serve as a portfolio, but also as a place where I intend to try new things, record and cement what I've been learning, and maybe even teach someone a thing or two.

The goal is iteration. It's staying simple for now.

## Changelog

- 6/19/2021: Added click-to-scroll behavior and updated copy, finally updated default branch.
- 5/4/2021: Added an animated element to indicate that the site should be scrolled.
- 5/3/2021: Lighthouse was unable to run because all content initially had `opacity: 0;`. Changed this so the first element on the page has an initial opacity of `1`. Lighthouse works with high scores! Also updated some semantic HTML.
- 2/22/2021: Launch redesign v.1.
