This was the first project I submitted for my bootcamp: a personal portfolio, a practical first project and one I had fun with. I'm totally revamping it 3 years post-bootcamp. The space will continue to serve as a portfolio, but also as a place where I intend to try new things, record and cement what I've been learning, and maybe even teach someone a thing or two.

The goal is iteration. It's staying simple for now.
