## a.k.a. a page about me

### a.k.a. no need to fork or contribute :wink:

_and this README just exists so I can practice Markdown_

This was the first project I submitted for my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program: a practical first project and one I had fun with. I received good constructive feedback in my code review, and it's exciting now to see my little project as a **real** website.

#### Here's what I plan to work on next:

- [x] Add Google Analytics to the page
- [ ] Add better contact information
  - [ ] e-mail form
  - [ ] sign up for Twitter? (...)
  - [ ] update LinkedIn
  - [x] add GitHub link!
- [ ] Add current career history after featured projects
  - [ ] printable version of resume
    - [ ] redo resume
- [ ] Take a photo of my cat for the footer image :heart_eyes_cat:
- [ ] Redesign layout for 2x screen size
  - [ ] maybe projects flow up next to 'about me'
