				&quot;Dressing is an individual act, but it is also a deeply social
				one.&quot; (291)
			</p>
			<p>
				As I&#39;ve been making my own clothes over the last year, and as
				I&#39;ve grown more and more disillusioned with fast fashion and
				shopping over the last several years, I hadn&#39;t thought too much
				about how the fashion industry became what it is today. I grew up in
				Massachusetts and visited mills on field trips; I read historical
				fiction about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. I thought about my mom
				sewing clothes for me and my sister, about couturiers and Project Runway
				competitors, about Victorian dresses, about homespun cloth. But I
				thought I had no other option than the mall, or the stores in Soho, or
				thrift stores. Making your own clothes is not something most people
				imagine is feasible, certainly not much beyond knitting a scarf or maybe
				a hat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Worn doesn&#39;t get into the details of making one&#39;s own garments,
				but rather traces the stories of garments through history. The tales are
				deeply political, exploitative, destructive, and always focused on
				money. Why don&#39;t people talk about these things more? What changed
				since that factory collapsed in Bangladesh? When will it happen again?
			</p>
			<p>
				The transformation of fashion from a homemade, homegrown industry to a
				mass-produced one reminds me of how we have increasingly become ignorant
				of and separated from our food systems. That is changing, with books
				like The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma, the rising popularity of greenmarkets
				and backyard gardens, and pandemic sourdough projects. Maybe the time is
				coming for fashion to change, too.
			</p>
			<p>Here are some of my takeaways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In Europe and North America, pre-Industrial Revolution, linen was
					often grown, processed, spun, woven, and made into garments from flax
					that was grown on one&#39;s own farmland, similar to their other
					crops. Homespun!
				</li>
				<li>
					Sewing a garment cannot be a fully machine-automated process.
					People&#39;s hands are necessary.
				</li>
				<li>
					Previously, I had thought that cotton and specifically organic cotton
					were &quot;good&quot; fabrics to look for, but I learned that cotton
					is an extremely thirsty plant. Aquifers are being drained in the
					middle US to keep it watered. In India and China, lands have turned
					into deserts as a result of industrial cotton farming practices.
					There&#39;s also the extreme quantity of toxic agrochemicals involved
					in growing such huge amounts of genetically modified plants - runoff,
					worker exposure.
				</li>
				<li>
					Textile production has been used by those in power (the East India
					Trading Company, the US Government) to completely transform countries
					and people groups - their way of living, their land, their customs -
					such as Indian textile makers and Navajo weavers.
				</li>
				<li>
					A highly neurotoxic solvent called carbon disulfide is used to make
					synthetic fabrics like rayon. For years after this discovery, workers
					were getting sick and dying from exposure to this chemical. For a long
					time, industry owners hid this fact and prevented investigations to
					keep profiting.
				</li>
				<li>
					Export Processing Zones are legal entities, like city-states, that
					allow duty-free imports of raw materials needed to produce exports.
					They provide tax breaks, infrastructure and communication services
					that are typically higher quality than in the country where they are
					housed, and &quot;easy acess to low-wage-labor foreign
					multinationals&quot; (198).
				</li>
				<li>
					The Rare Breeds Survival Trust in Britain was established in 1973 to
					prevent native British sheep breeds from going extinct. Look at these
					beautiful and weird breeds like the
